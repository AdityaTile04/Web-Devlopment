# Terminal Basics

Welcome to the Terminal Basics guide! This repository aims to provide a comprehensive overview of fundamental terminal commands for navigating your system, managing files and directories, and understanding paths and flags.

## Basic Commands

### `ls`

Lists the files and directories in the current directory.

### `cd`

Changes the current directory.

### `pwd`

Prints the current working directory.

### `mkdir`

Creates a new directory.

### `touch`

## Navigation Commands

### `cd`

- `cd [directory_name]`: Change the current directory to the specified directory.
- `cd ..`: Move one directory up.
- `cd ~`: Move to the user's home directory.
- `cd /`: Move to the root directory.

## Path in Navigation

Paths are used to specify the location of files and directories.

- **Absolute Path**: Specifies the location from the root directory, e.g., `/home/user/Documents`.
- **Relative Path**: Specifies the location relative to the current directory, e.g., `Documents/`.

## Making Directories

To create a directory, use the `mkdir` command followed by the directory name:

```bash
mkdir directory_name
```

# Terminal Commands Reference

Welcome to the Terminal Commands Reference repository! This repository provides a comprehensive guide to common terminal commands, flags, and essential operations for managing files and directories via the command line interface (CLI).

## Introduction

Terminal commands are instructions provided to the operating system through the CLI. They enable users to perform various tasks, including file system navigation, file manipulation, program execution, and more, directly from the terminal.

## Understanding Flags

Flags, also known as options or switches, are additional parameters appended to terminal commands to modify their behavior or provide specific instructions. Flags typically begin with a hyphen (-) followed by a letter or word. Understanding flags is crucial for customizing command behavior according to specific requirements.

## The `touch` Command

The `touch` command is used to create empty files or update timestamps on existing files. It's a useful utility for quickly generating placeholder files without the need for a text editor. This section provides an overview of the `touch` command syntax and common flags for modifying file timestamps.

## Deleting Files and Folders

Managing files and directories often involves deleting unwanted or obsolete items. This section covers the `rm` command for deleting files and demonstrates how to remove both individual files and entire directories. Additionally, it discusses precautions and best practices to avoid accidental data loss.
